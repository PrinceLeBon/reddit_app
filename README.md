## Contribution

How to Contribute I would love to receive contributions to this project! If you would like to
contribute, please follow these steps:

- Step 1: Identify a problem or opportunity to contribute

- Step 2: Fork the deposit Once you have identified a problem or opportunity for contribution, you
  need to create your own copy of the repository (called a "fork")

- Step 3: Set up your development environment After forking the repository, you need to configure
  your development environment to be able to work on the project. Please see
  the [README.md](https://github.com/PrinceLeBon/reddit_app/blob/main/README.md) file for
  instructions on how to install dependencies and set up your environment.

- Step 4: Write code Now that you have set up your development environment, you can start writing
  code to solve the problem or add new features.

- Step 5: Submit a pull request Once you have finished writing code, you can submit a pull request
  to get your code into the main repository. To do this, you need to click the "New pull request"
  button on your fork page on Github, select your fork as the source and the main repository as the
  target, and then click the "Create pull request" button. Be sure to provide a detailed description
  of what you have done and any additional information needed to understand your contribution.

- Step 6: Discuss and integrate Other contributors and project maintainers will discuss your
  contribution and may make comments and suggestions to improve your code. Once you have received
