  need to create your own copy of the repository (called a "fork")

- Step 3: Set up your development environment After forking the repository, you need to configure
  your development environment to be able to work on the project. Please see

- Step 5: Submit a pull request Once you have finished writing code, you can submit a pull request
  to get your code into the main repository. To do this, you need to click the "New pull request"
  button on your fork page on Github, select your fork as the source and the main repository as the
